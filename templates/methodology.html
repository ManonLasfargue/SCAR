<h1>Methodological framework</h1>

<p class="subtitle">
SCAR is designed as a <strong>carbon decision-support tool for research projects</strong>.
Rather than producing exhaustive life-cycle inventories, its ambition is to make
the environmental implications of research practices
<strong>explicit, interpretable, and discussable</strong>,
while remaining compatible with academic constraints and real-world decision-making.
</p>

<div class="accordion">

<!-- 1 -->
<div class="accordion-item">
  <div class="accordion-header">
    1. Objectives and epistemological positioning
    <span class="arrow">›</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>
SCAR was conceived in response to a growing tension within contemporary academia.
On the one hand, research increasingly addresses environmental and climate-related issues;
on the other hand, the environmental footprint of research practices themselves
remains poorly quantified, weakly problematised, and rarely integrated into decision-making.
</p>

<p>
The primary objective of SCAR is therefore not to produce an exhaustive or definitive
carbon accounting of research activities, but rather to provide an
<strong>operational and reflexive framework</strong> allowing researchers to
understand where emissions arise within a given project, and how these emissions relate
to concrete scientific and organisational choices.
</p>

<p>
From an epistemological perspective, SCAR deliberately positions itself
between two extremes. It does not aim to reproduce the complexity of full
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies, which require detailed inventories,
specialised expertise, and extensive data that are rarely available at the project level.
Conversely, it avoids purely symbolic or declarative approaches that would
reduce carbon assessment to generic averages disconnected from actual practices.
</p>

<p>
SCAR is thus best understood as a <strong>decision-support and discussion tool</strong>.
Its purpose is to inform choices when several research configurations are possible,
to identify structural emission drivers, and to make trade-offs explicit.
It is not designed to rank projects, disciplines, or individuals, nor to prescribe
a single optimal research model.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
SCAR answers the following question:
<em>“Given a research objective, which activities generate emissions, and which
levers can realistically be mobilised without undermining scientific integrity?”</em>
</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

    2. Scope definition and system boundaries
    <span class="arrow">›</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>
Defining system boundaries is a central methodological step in any carbon assessment.
In SCAR, these boundaries are intentionally restricted in order to maintain
both analytical relevance and practical usability.
</p>

<p>
Only emission sources that satisfy two criteria are included:
first, they must represent a <strong>non-negligible contribution</strong> to the overall
carbon footprint of research activities; second, they must be
<strong>meaningfully influenced by project-level decisions</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Based on these criteria, SCAR includes several major categories of emissions:
mobility (air, rail, and road transport), energy use during missions,
digital practices (devices, servers, cloud computing, AI usage),
food consumption associated with research travel, and accommodation
related to conferences or fieldwork.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, emissions embedded in long-term institutional infrastructure
(such as building construction, campus heating systems, or central administrative services)
are excluded. While these emissions are significant at the scale of institutions,
they cannot be robustly attributed to individual projects without introducing
arbitrary allocation rules that would obscure rather than clarify responsibility.
</p>

<p>
This boundary choice reflects a methodological trade-off:
SCAR sacrifices exhaustiveness in order to preserve interpretability
and to focus attention on levers that researchers can realistically discuss,
negotiate, or influence.

    3. Emission factors and data sources
    <span class="arrow">›</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>
All numerical estimates produced by SCAR rely on emission factors expressed
in kilograms of CO₂ equivalent (kgCO₂e) per unit of activity.
These factors are drawn from publicly available and widely recognised sources,
primarily national databases produced by ADEME and methodological frameworks
such as GES 1point5.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the activity considered, emission factors may be expressed per kilometre
travelled, per hour of use, per device-year, or per meal.
For example, air travel emissions are computed as the product of travelled distance
and a distance-specific emission factor, while digital equipment emissions are
annualised over an estimated lifespan and allocated to project usage.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, emission factors are treated as <strong>order-of-magnitude estimates</strong>.
SCAR does not claim to measure emissions with high precision, as such precision
would be illusory given uncertainties in usage patterns, technological heterogeneity,
and reporting practices.
</p>

<div class="highlight">
Precision is intentionally traded for transparency:
the goal is not to produce exact numbers, but to provide
robust and interpretable approximations.

    4. Calculation logic and aggregation
    <span class="arrow">›</span>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">
      <p>
The computation logic implemented in SCAR follows a deliberately simple and transparent structure.
For each emission category, user-reported activity data are multiplied
by the corresponding emission factor.
</p>

<p>
This yields a set of category-level emissions, each expressed in kgCO₂e.
The total carbon footprint of the project is then computed as the sum
of all category-level emissions.
</p>

<p>
Only categories with non-zero emissions are displayed in the results.
This design choice avoids visual clutter and allows dominant emission drivers
to be immediately identified.
</p>

<p>
No weighting, normalisation, or optimisation procedure is applied.
All emissions are treated symmetrically, reflecting the physical equivalence
of CO₂e regardless of their source.

<div class="accordion-item">

    5. Scenario construction and interpretation
    <span class="arrow">›</span>
  </div>

  <div class="accordion-content">
    <div class="accordion-content-inner">

      <p>
        Scenarios constitute a central analytical component of SCAR. They are not designed
        to predict future emissions, nor to prescribe mandatory reduction targets.
        Instead, they function as <strong>counterfactual explorations</strong>: each scenario
        asks how the carbon footprint of a given research project would change if a limited
        set of practices were modified, all other parameters being held constant.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a methodological perspective, scenarios are constructed by applying
        <strong>conservative adjustment coefficients</strong> to selected emission categories
        in the baseline configuration. The baseline footprint serves as a reference point,
        and each scenario modifies only a subset of activities. This ensures that changes
        in total emissions can be directly attributed to the simulated transformation,
        rather than to unrelated assumptions.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Scenario results quantify <strong>relative sensitivity</strong>, not performance.
        They indicate where emissions are responsive to change, not where reductions are
        required.
      </div>

      <h4>Modal substitution scenario</h4>

      <p>
        The modal substitution scenario focuses exclusively on <strong>mobility-related
        emissions</strong>, which often constitute a significant share of the carbon
        footprint in projects involving fieldwork, conferences, or international collaboration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Computationally, this scenario applies reduction factors to high-carbon transport
        modes—primarily short- and medium-haul flights—by partially reallocating them to
        lower-carbon alternatives such as rail transport. Importantly, the scenario does
        <strong>not eliminate travel</strong> and does not assume unrealistic behavioural
        change. Travel volumes remain constant; only transport modes are modified where
        substitution is technically and organisationally plausible.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resulting percentage reduction shown in the results table represents the share
        of baseline emissions attributable to avoidable transport intensity. A high reduction
        value indicates that mobility constitutes a structurally important and potentially
        adjustable component of the project’s footprint.
      </p>

      <h4>Digital sobriety scenario</h4>

      <p>
        The digital sobriety scenario addresses emissions related to
        <strong>computational infrastructure and digital practices</strong>, including
        servers, cloud services, data storage, and intensive computing tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than assuming radical technological change, this scenario simulates
        <strong>moderate efficiency gains</strong>. These include reduced server
        over-provisioning, shorter data retention periods, improved task scheduling,
        or the pooling of computational resources at the laboratory or institutional level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Methodologically, proportional reductions are applied to digital emission categories,
        while all non-digital activities remain unchanged. The percentage reduction reflects
        the extent to which the project’s footprint depends on <em>digital intensity choices</em>
        rather than on unavoidable scientific requirements.
      </p>

      <h4>Utility-aware scenario</h4>

      <p>
        The utility-aware scenario introduces an explicit reflection on
        <strong>proportionality</strong>. It does not evaluate the legitimacy of the research
        project, nor does it compare projects or disciplines. Instead, it explores how
        emissions might be contextualised when research activities are weighted by their
        perceived scientific or societal usefulness.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a computational standpoint, selected emission categories are modulated according
        to the utility score provided by the user. Higher utility scores result in smaller
        relative adjustments, reflecting the idea that emissions associated with highly
        valuable activities may be less negotiable. Lower scores introduce stronger
        proportional constraints.
      </p>

      <p>
        The percentage reduction associated with this scenario should therefore be interpreted
        as an <strong>analytical illustration</strong> rather than a recommendation. It
        highlights how carbon considerations can be integrated into strategic reflection
        without reducing research value to a single numerical indicator.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Taken together, scenarios in SCAR are designed to support
        <strong>informed, context-sensitive decision-making</strong>, rather than optimisation
        or benchmarking.

Results produced by SCAR should always be interpreted in context.
They depend on assumptions, reporting choices, and project-specific constraints,

The tool does not attempt to evaluate the legitimacy, relevance,

Nor does it aim to minimise emissions at all costs.
Scientific objectives, epistemic diversity, and academic freedom
